## Oct. 2014 - Jan. 2015

* Maera theme core release
* Maera Bootstrap shell release
* Maera-EDD addon release
* Maera-WooCommerce addon release
* Conversion of additional Shoestrap addons to Maera

### Notes:

* When Maera is released and all Shoestrap addons have been migrated to Maera, Shoestrap will be removed from the marketplace and all items will be replaced by their Maera equivalents.
* Shoestrap support will continue until March of 2016 at which point we will stop providing free support for it.
* The Maera theme will only include a core shell. All other shells (frameworks) - including Bootstrap, will be provided as extra plugins.

## Jan. - Mar. 2015

* Migration script (Shoestrap to Maera)

### Notes:
* Since the themes are completely different and their concepts are not even relevant, the migration script will under no circomstances be considered as a complete migration script. It will only work for the bootstrap shell and will compy all available options from one theme to the other. However some styling differences are unavoidable as not all options are available on the Maera-Bootstrap plugin (gor good reason).
