## Sep. - Dec. 2014

* Maera theme core release
* Maera Bootstrap framework addon release
* Maera-EDD addon release
* Maera-WooCommerce addon release
* Additional SS addons conversion to Maera

When Maera is released and all Shoestrap addons have been migrated to Maera, we will be removing SS from the marketplace and replacing them with the Maera ones.

The Maera theme will only have the core framework with it. All other frameworks (including Bootstrap) will be provided as plugins that the user can install.
